# React Component Testing: Movies App

The Movies app allows you to add new movies to a movie list and say whether you like the movie or not. To guarantee the code quality, we want to test our components extensively.

Take a look at the open test todos and try to solve them. Pay attention to the hints added to some of the tests to help you write them.

## Development

To run project commands locally, you need to install the dependencies using `npm i` first.

You can then use the following commands:

- `npm run start` to start the development server
- `npm run test` to run the tests in watch mode (if available)

> ðŸ’¡ This project requires a bundler. You can use `npm run start` to start the development server. You can then view the project in the browser at `http://localhost:3000`. The Live Preview Extension for Visual Studio Code will **not** work for this project.
